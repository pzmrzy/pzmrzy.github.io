                            To attract more users on different platforms, many projects release their versions in multiple programming languages (\emph{e.g.}, Java and C\#).
                            They typically have many code snippets that implement similar functionalities, \emph{i.e.}, cross-language clones.
                            Programmers often need to track and modify cross-language clones consistently to maintain similar functionalities across different language implementations.
                            In literature, researchers have proposed approaches to detect cross-language clones,
                            mostly for languages that share a common intermediate language (such as the .NET language family) so that techniques for detecting single-language clones can be applied.
                            As a result, those approaches cannot detect cross-language clones for many projects that are not implemented in a .NET language.
                            To overcome the limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel approach, \emph{CLCMiner}, that detects cross-language clones automatically without the need of an intermediate language.
                            Our approach mines such clones from revision histories, which reflect how programmers maintain cross-language clones in practice.
                            We have implemented a prototype tool for our approach and conducted an evaluation on five open source projects that have versions in Java and C\#. The results show that \emph{CLCMiner} achieves high accuracy and point to promising future work.

                            The Analysis and Prediction of the Behavior in User Adopt Application Based on Real Social Network.Recently, behavioral diffusion is a core study area in Social Network. On social network site, users can add friends, while the behavior on these social network sites may be spread through their friend relations by some mechanisms. Past studies suggest that as long as there is a friend relationship between two users, the behavior will be effectively delivered with equal chance from one user to his friends. However, this information diffusion process may be affected by the attribute of users, the relation between friends, and the position at which user locates. In this research, I acquired the real social network site data, studied the behavior of user adopt application on this site, spread on the network. First I selected these data, then analyzed the attribute of users, their relation and their position on the network. Base on the analysis result, I built different model to predict the time of one user adopt the application.
