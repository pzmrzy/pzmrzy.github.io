                [Abstract]The proliferation of diverse kinds of programming languages and platforms makes it a common need to have the same functionality implemented in different languages for different platforms, such as Java for Android applications and C# for Windows phone applications. Although versions of code written in different languages appear syntactically quite different from each other, they are intended to implement the same software and typically contain many code snippets that implement similar functionalities, which we call cross-language clones. When the version of code in one language evolves according to changing functionality requirements and/or bug fixes, its cross-language clones may also need be changed to maintain consistent implementations for the same functionality. Thus, it is needed to have automated ways to locate and track cross-language clones within the evolving software. In the literature, approaches for detecting cross-language clones are only for languages that share a common intermediate language (such as the .NET language family) because they are built on techniques for detecting single-language clones. To extend the capability of cross-language clone detection to more diverse kinds of languages, we propose a novel automated approach, CLCMiner, without the need of an intermediate language. It mines such clones from revision histories, based on our assumption that revisions to different versions of code implemented in different languages may naturally reflect how programmers change cross-language clones in practice, and that similarities among the revisions (referred to as clones in diffs or diff clones) may indicate actual similar code. We have implemented a prototype and applied it to ten open source projects implementations in both Java and C#. The reported clones that occur in revision histories are of high precisions (89% on average) and recalls (95% on average). Compared with token-based code clone detection tools that can treat code as plain texts, our tool can detect significantly more cross-language clones. All the evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility of revision-history based techniques for detecting cross-language clones without intermediates and point to promising future work.

                [Abstract] To attract more users on different platforms, many projects release their versions in multiple programming languages (<i>e.g.</i>, Java and C\#).
                They typically have many code snippets that implement similar functionalities, <i>i.e.</i>, cross-language clones.
                Programmers often need to track and modify cross-language clones consistently to maintain similar functionalities across different language implementations.
                In literature, researchers have proposed approaches to detect cross-language clones,
                mostly for languages that share a common intermediate language (such as the .NET language family) so that techniques for detecting single-language clones can be applied.
                As a result, those approaches cannot detect cross-language clones for many projects that are not implemented in a .NET language.
                To overcome the limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel approach, <i>CLCMiner</i>, that detects cross-language clones automatically without the need of an intermediate language.
                Our approach mines such clones from revision histories, which reflect how programmers maintain cross-language clones in practice.
                We have implemented a prototype tool for our approach and conducted an evaluation on five open source projects that have versions in Java and C\#. The results show that <i>CLCMiner</i> achieves high accuracy and point to promising future work.

                <b>Abstract:</b>
                The Analysis and Prediction of the Behavior in User Adopt Application Based on Real Social Network.Recently, behavioral diffusion is a core study area in Social Network. On social network site, users can add friends, while the behavior on these social network sites may be spread through their friend relations by some mechanisms. Past studies suggest that as long as there is a friend relationship between two users, the behavior will be effectively delivered with equal chance from one user to his friends. However, this information diffusion process may be affected by the attribute of users, the relation between friends, and the position at which user locates. In this research, I acquired the real social network site data, studied the behavior of user adopt application on this site, spread on the network. First I selected these data, then analyzed the attribute of users, their relation and their position on the network. Base on the analysis result, I built different model to predict the time of one user adopt the application.
